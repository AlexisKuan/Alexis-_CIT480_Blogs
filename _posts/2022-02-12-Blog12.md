<h1>What is an Angular Service?</h1>
<p>For data or logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that you want to share across components, you create a service class. A service class definition is immediately preceded by the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator. The decorator provides the metadata that allows other providers to be injected as dependencies into your class. An Angular component can assign certain tasks to a service such as sending or fetching data from a server, validating user input, or saving directly into the console. By assigning these tasks in an injectiable service class, you can make these tasks available to any component within your project. This allows you to inject different providers of the same kind of service wherever applicable.</p>

<h1>Dependecy Injection</h1>
<p>Dependecy Injection is built into the Angular framework and used to provide new components with the services or other things they need. By "injecting" a service into a component, you can give the component access to that service class. To define a class as a service in Angular, use the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator to provide the metadata that allows Angular to inject it into a component as a dependency. Similarly, use the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator to indicate that a component or other class (such as another service, a pipe, or an NgModule) has a dependency. </p>
