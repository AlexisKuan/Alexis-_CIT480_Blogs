<h1>What is Docker?</h1>
<p>Docker is an open platform for building, delivering, and operating applications. Docker allows you to isolate your apps from your infrastructure, allowing you to quickly release software. Docker allows you to manage your infrastructure the same way you control your applications. You may drastically minimize the time between writing code and executing it in production by leveraging Docker's approaches for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Containers are used to develop an application and its supporting components</li>
    <li>Containers are used for distributing and testing applications</li>
    <li>Once ready, your application can be deployed into a production environment, as a container or orchestrated service.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What can Docker be Used For?</h1>
<p>The main takeaway from using Docker is that it streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are beneficial for allowing continuous integration and continuous delivery for a work environment. Docker makes sharing code easier because developers could write locally and share their work using containers. Docker can also be used to create test environments for various applications before pushing into production. It also allows developers to create various environments; coding can be done withing a dev environment before being deployed into a test environment until it is ultimately pushed to production. All in all, Docker is very portable and flexible to fit the needs of developers.</p>
<p>This past week I used Docker to create and run a Prometheus server locally. I was able to install all the necessary tools and files I needed within the container I created, test, and run my server. Docker made it very easy to create my work environment.</p>
<h1>Docker Building Blocks</h1>
<p>Docker uses a client-server architecture.</p>
<dl>
    <dt><b>Docker daemon</b></dt>
        <dd><code>dockerd</code>The Docker daemon(a computer program that runs as a background process) actively listens for Docker requests and manages Docker objects</dd>
    <dt><b>Docker Client</b></dt>
        <dd>Users interact with Docker primarily through <code>docker</code>. Commands that contain <code>docker</code> are sent to <code>dockerd</code>, which then processes them.</dd>

    <dt><b>Docker Registries</b></dt>
        <dd>Docker registries store Docker images</dd>
        <dd><code>docker pull</code>or<code>docker run</code> commands pull the required images from your configured registry</dd>
        <dd>The <code>docker push</code> command pushes your image to your configured registry.</dd>
    <dt><b>Images</b></dt>
        <dd>An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. An image is often based on another image with some customization done (E.x. Ubuntu image)
    <dt><b>Containers</b></dt>
        <dd>A container is a runnable instance of an image. It is flexible as you can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container with ease.</dd>
