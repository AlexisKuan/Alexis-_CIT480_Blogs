<h1>What is Linux?</h1>
<p>Linux is an operating system just like Windows, iOS, Mac OS, and ChromeOS. Android is powered by the Linux operating system making it one of the most popular platforms in the world. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your computer. Simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Linux is composed of several different parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Bootloader</b> The software that manages the boot process of your computer. This will be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.</li>
    <li><b>Kernel:</b> This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called "Linux". The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.</li>
    <li><b>Init system:</b> This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is "systemd", which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader.</li>
    <li><b>Daemons:</b> These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.</li>
    <li><b>Graphical server:</b> This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.</li>
    <li><b>Desktop environment:</b> This is the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to choose from (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment, KDE, Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes built-in applications such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games.</li>
    <li><b>Applications:</b> Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Just like Windows and macOS, Linux offers many software titles that can be easily found and installed. Most modern Linux distributions include App Store-like tools that centralize and simplify application installation.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Why Use Linux?</h1>
<p>
If you find yourself battling obstacles with your current OS like viruses, malware, slow performance, crashes, high costs, and licensing fees, Linux is the solution for you. Linux has evolved into one of the most reliable computer ecosystems on the planet. Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you have the perfect solution for a desktop platform. You can install Linux on as many computers as you like without paying amything for software or server licensing.</p>
