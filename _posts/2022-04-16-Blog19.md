<h1>What is ESLint? </h1>
<p>ESLint is an open source JavaScript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. <b>Code linting</b> is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere to certain style guidelines. There are code linters for most programming languages, and compilers sometimes incorporate linting into the compilation process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>JavaScript, being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially prone to developer error. Without the benefit of a compilation process, JavaScript code is typically executed in order to find syntax or other errors. Linting tools like ESLint allow developers to discover problems with their JavaScript code without executing it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The primary reason ESLint was created was to allow developers to create their own linting rules. ESLint is designed to have all rules completely pluggable. The default rules are written just like any plugin rules would be. They can all follow the same pattern, both for the rules themselves as well as tests. While ESLint will ship with some built-in rules to make it useful from the start, you'll be able to dynamically load rules at any point in time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ESLint is written using Node.js to provide a fast runtime environment and easy installation via npm.</p>
<h1>How to get Started with ESLint</h1>
<dl>
    <dt><b>Prerequisite:</b> Node.js (^12.22.0, ^14.17.0, or >=16.0.0) </dt>
    <dt>Install ESLint using npm or yarn:</dt>
        <dd>{% highlight ruby %}
            npm install eslint --save-dev

            # or

            yarn add eslint --dev
            {% endhighlight %}
        </dd>
    <dt>Set up the configuration file</dt>
        <dd>
        {% highlight ruby %}
        npm init @eslint/config

        # or

        yarn create @eslint/config
        {% endhighlight %}
        </dd>
    <dt>Run ESLint onf any file or directory like this:</dt>
        <dd>
        {% highlight ruby %}
        npx eslint yourfile.js

        # or

        yarn run eslint yourfile.js
        {% endhighlight %}
        </dd>
</dl>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>After running <code>npm init @eslint/config</code>, you'll have a <code>.eslintrc.{js,yml,json}</code> file in your directory. In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Adding rules allows ESLint to be completely configurable to your own needs.Also, adding rules is as easy as adding to the "rules" section in the configuration file</p>
