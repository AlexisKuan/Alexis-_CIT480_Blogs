<h1>What is Terraform?</h1>
<p> HashiCorp Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool that allows DevOps engineers to programmatically arrange the physical resources an application requires to run. Infrastructure as code is an IT practice that manages an application's underlying IT infrastructure through programming. This approach to resource allocation allows developers to logically manage, monitor and provision resources,as opposed to requiring that an operations team manually configure each required resource. Terraform users define and enforce infrastructure configurations by using a JSON-like configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). HCL's simple syntax makes it easy for DevOps teams to provision and re-provision infrastructure across multiple cloud and on-premises data centers.</p>
