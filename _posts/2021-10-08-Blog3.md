    <h1><b>What is AWS?</b></h1>
        <p>Amazon Web Services or AWS for short, is an evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) options. AWS also offers organization tools such as database storage, content delivery services, and computing power. AWS was created to handle Amazon.com's online retail operations. It was one of the first companies to introduce a "pay as you go" cloud computing model.</p>
    <h1><b>How AWS works</b></h1>
        <p>AWS is separated into different services, each which can be configured in different ways based on the user's needs. Users are able to configure for their individual needs or for the needs of a large corporation. AWS is very flexible and scalable. AWS offers more than 100 different services, some of the services include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compute</li>
            <li>Storage Databases</li>
            <li>Data Management</li>
            <li>Networking</li>
            <li>Monitoring</li>
            <li>Security</li>
            <li>And many more..</li>
        </ul>
    <h1><b>Benefit of Using AWS</b></h1>
        <p>A large benefit of using the services AWS provides is the fact that they are easily available to anyone. AWS offeres services from dozens of data centers spread across availability zones in regions across the world. Availability Zones or AZs are locations that contain multiple physical data centers. A business can choose one or multiple AZs for a variety of reasons, such as compliance and proximity to end customers. An example of a benefit of AZs is, an AWS customer can spin up virtual machines and replicate data in different AZs to achieve a highly reliable infrastructure that is resistant to failures of individual servers or an entire data center. AWS being a cloud service allows users to not have to have their own physical data centers and create infrastructures to their liking.</p>
