<h1><b>What is CSS?</b></h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets or CSS,just like HTML, is not a programming language or markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. A style sheet language is a computer language that expresses the presentation of structured documents. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</p>
<h1><b>What are the Benefits of Using CSS?</b></h1>
<p>CSS saves a lot of time and solved a big problem of HTML. When introduced, HTML was not intented to contain tags for formatting a web page. HTML was strictly created to describe the content of a web page. So with CSS, all of the page styling can be done outside of the HTML code. With a single <code>.css</code> file, you can change the whole look of an entire website. </p>

<dl>
    <dd><b>Selector</b></dd>
        <dt>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset.(ex.<code><p></code>) It defines the element(s) to be styled. To style a different element, change the selector.</dt>
    <dd><b>Declaration</b></dd>
        <dt>This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code>. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</dt>
    <dd><b>Properties</b></dd>
        <dt>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (ex. <code>color</code> is a property of the <code><p></code> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</dt>
    <dd><b>Property Value</b></dd>
        <dt>This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (ex. There are many <code>color</code> values in addition to <code>red</code>.)</dt>
