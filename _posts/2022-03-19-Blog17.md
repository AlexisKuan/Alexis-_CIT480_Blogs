<h1>What is Amazon ECR?</h1>
<p>ECR is an acronym for the “Elastic container registry”. In simple terms, it is the  “Amazon Docker Hub” of your containers. You can push all your local container's images from your "local" to ECR. ECR is the home for all your pushed container images where they can later be used by the ECS service to get deployed on the Amazon platform.</p>
<h1>What is Amazon ECS?</h1>
<p>ECS is an acronym for “EC2 container service”. In simple terms, it provides a way to deploy your Docker containers over the Amazon platform on an EC2 instance or serverless(Fargate). ECS helps you deploy your containers and helps you provision your own containers.
If you have a container running on your local machine that you want to make live on a public platform to be publically accessible, AWS ECS is the solution for that along with “ECR”, “Task definitions”, and “services”.</p>
<h1>Some ECS Terms</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Cluster:</b> ECS cluster is a regional grouping of one or more container instances on which you can run task requests. When an instance launches, the ECS-agent software on the server registers the instance to an ECS Cluster. You can choose an existing VPC, or create a new one to spin up your container instances.</li>
<li><b>Task Definition:</b> It is the complete definition of your tasks(in simple terms, your containers) and to describe how containers should be provisioned. Here You need to provide a link to ECR’s saved container images, CPU units, Memory, Container ports to expose, network type and many more. i.e. you are defining your containers and how to launch them via Task definitions.</li>
<li><b>Tasks:</b> It is simply “ a running container “. The description you provided for your containers in "task definition", "tasks" are the result of that. It can be thought of as a “runing instance” of a Task Definition.</li>
<li><b>Service:</b> ECS Service allows you to run your container instances as defined in your task definition. It also allows you to run and maintain a specified number of instances by configuring the auto-scaling policies. If any of your tasks fail or stop for any reason, the Amazon ECS service scheduler launches another instance of your task definition to replace it and maintain the desired count of tasks. You can optionally run your service behind a load balancer, The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.</li>
<li><b>Container Instance:</b> This is nothing but an EC2 instance that is part of an ECS Cluster and has Docker and the ECS-agent running on it.</li>
</ul>
