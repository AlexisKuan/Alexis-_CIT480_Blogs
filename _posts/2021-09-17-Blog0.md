<h1> What is Bash?</h1>
    <p>Bash is a Unix shell and command language first released in 1989. Also, it is a command processor that usually runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash was written for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. Since release is has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. </p>
<h1>What can be done with Bash?</h1>
    <p>Bash can read and execute commands from a file, also called a shell script. Bash also supports brace expansion, command line completion, basic debugging, and signal handling. It can also execute the vast majority of Bourne shell scripts without modification. </p>
    <p>This week I used Bash within a command line to configure and install packages to set up a simple Prometheus Server. Bash was used to create a new Docker container and map local ports to the container. I also used it to install files from the internet as well as tools I could use on the command line. Once my server was finished setting up, I was able to start the server with an "execute" command. </p>

<h1>Limitations of Bash</h1>
    <p>There are certain things Bash is not very good at:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Speed: Bash is slow. If speed is important, Bash may not be the best choice.</li>
            <li>Floating Point Math: Bash has only integer math</li>
            <li> Variable Typing: Bash does not really support strong variable types.</li>
            <li>Sorting: Bash can't sort data sets</li>
    </ul>
