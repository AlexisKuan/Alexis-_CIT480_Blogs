    <h1><b>What is Python?</b></h1>
        <p>Python is an object oriented, high level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python is very useful for Rapid Application Development as well as scripting or connexting existing components together. It is useful because its high level build in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability which leads to reduced cost of program maintenance. This programming language also supports modules and packages, which pushes for program modularity and code re-use.</p>
    <h1><b>Why do programmers like to use Python?</b></h1>
        <p> Programmers like to use Python because of the increased productivity it brings. Increased productivity is achieved because there is no compilation step, meaning that the edit --> test --> debug cycle is very fast. Also, Debugging Python is quite simple. Instead of a bug or bad input causing a segmentation fault, the interpreter will raise an exception when it discovers an error. Another reason why Python is so popular is because it is versatile, has simple syntax, and is ultimately beginner friendly. Entry level coders will have an easy time learning Python and also hav a large and active community to provide them with useful resources.</p>
    <h1><b>What can Python be used for?</b></h1>
        <p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Web Development</dt>
                    <dd>Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application. Python’s role in web development can include sending data to and from servers, processing data and communicating with databases, URL routing, and ensuring security.</dd>
                <dt> Data analysis and machine learning</dt>
                    <dd>Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks. Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots.</dd>
                <dt>Automation</dt>
                    <dd> Automation can be used to check for errors across multiple files, convert files, execute simple math, and remove duplicates in data. Python can even be used by relative beginners to automate simple tasks on the computer, such as: renaming files, finding and downloading online content or sending emails or texts at desired intervals.</dd>
                <dt>Software testing</dt>
                    <dd>In software development, Python can aid in tasks like build control, bug tracking, and testing. With Python, software developers can automate testing for new products or features. </dd>
            </dl>
          Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks. </p>
