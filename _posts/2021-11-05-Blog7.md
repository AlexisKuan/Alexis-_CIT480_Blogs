<h1>What is MongoDB?</h1>
    <p>MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables.</p>
<h1>What are the features available in MongoDB?</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Each database contains collections which in turn contains documents. Each document can be different with a varying number of fields. The size and content of each document can be different from each other.</li>
    <li>The rows (or documents as called in MongoDB) don't need to have a schema defined beforehand. Instead, the fields can be created on the fly.</li>
    <li>The document structure is more in line with how developers construct their classes and objects in their respective programming languages. </li>
    <li>Scalability – The MongoDB environments are very scalable.</li>
    <li>The data model available within MongoDB allows you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures easily.</li>
    </ol>
<h1>Components of MongoDB Database Creation</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><code><b>_id</b></code> :This is a field required in every MongoDB document. The <code>_id</code> field represents a unique value in the MongoDB document. The <code>_id</code> field is like the document’s primary key. If you create a new document without an <code>_id</code> field, MongoDB will automatically create the field. </li>
        <li><b>Collection</b>  :This is a grouping of MongoDB documents. A collection exists within a single database.</li>
        <li><b>Database</b> :This is a container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A MongoDB server can store multiple databases.</li>
        <li><b>Document</b> :A record in a MongoDB collection is called a document. The document will consist of field name and values.</li>
        <li><b>Field</b> :This is a name/value pair in a document. A document has zero or more fields. </li>
        <li><b>JSON</b> :This is known as JavaScript Object Notation. This is a human-readable, plain text format for expressing structured data.</li>
    </ul>
