<h1>What are Github Actions? </h1>
<p>GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
<br>
<br>
GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository. For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.
<br>
<br>
GitHub provides Linux, Windows, and macOS virtual machines to run your workflows, or you can host your own self-hosted runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h1>What is Jenkins?</h1>
<p>Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.</p>
<h1>Jenkins Builds</h1>
<p>Builds can be triggered by various means, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scheduling via a cron-like mechanism</li>
    <li>A webhook that gets triggered upon pushed commits in a version control system</li>
    <li>Requesting a specific build URL</li>
    <li>After the other builds in the queue have completed</li>
    <li>Invoked by other builds</li>
</ul>
<h1> Jenkins Plugins</h1>
<p>Plugins have been released for Jenkins that extend its use to projects written in languages other than Java. Plugins are available for integrating Jenkins with most version control systems and bug databases. Many build tools are supported via their respective plugins. Plugins can also change the way Jenkins looks or add new functionality. There are a set of plugins dedicated for the purpose of unit testing that generate test reports in various formats and automated testing that supports automated tests. Builds can generate test reports in various formats supported by plugins and Jenkins can display the reports and generate trends and render them in the GUI.</p>
