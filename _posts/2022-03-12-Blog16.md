<h1>What is Mac OS? </h1>
<p>MacOS is the computer operating system for Apple desktops and laptops. It is a proprietary graphical OS that powers every Mac.
<br>
MacOS' performance is generally quick and responsive due to the OS being optimized for their specific hardware. Because Apple isn't making software for a handful of 3rd party companies, they can have extremely optimized devices that they manufacture themselves. Apple releases a new version of macOS approximately every year.
<br>
MacOS was introduced in 1984 to run Macintosh personal computers. The OS helped make graphical user interfaces popular, even inspiring Microsoft to move away from its user input method in favor of using GUIs for Windows OSs. MacOS can even go as far as being considered the pioneer of GUI based operating systems.</p>

<h1>MacOS Early Use</h1>
<p>Apple’s marketing for the introduction of the Macintosh focused heavily on its operating system’s intuitive ease of use. Unlike virtually all other PC at the time, the Mac OS was graphically based. Rather than typing commands and directory paths at text prompts, users moved a mouse pointer to visually navigate the Finder, a series of virtual folders and files, represented by icons. Most computer operating systems eventually adopted the GUI model. In the 1980s Apple made an agreement allowing Microsoft to use certain aspects of the Mac interface in early versions of Windows.</p>
