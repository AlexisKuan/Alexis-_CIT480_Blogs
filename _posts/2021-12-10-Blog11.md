<h1>What is Github?</h1>
<p>GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.Github can be best understood by its two main components; Version Control and Git.</p>
<h1>Version Control</h1>
<p>Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows and receives more additions, keeping track of changes and versions of the software becomes very important. Also, making sure that different versions of the software don't conflict with each other is important as well, hence the term: "version control". For example, if a developer wants to create an addition to the software, they wouldn't add it to the "official", working source code. They would do it in a development environment where they can test and break things without worry. Version Control lets devs work safely through branching and merging.When a developer creates a "branch" they duplicate the source code and can work on it safely without affecting the rest of the project. Once the code is working properly on the branch, they can "merge" the code into the main source code. All of these changes are logged and can be reverted if needed.</p>
<h1>What is Git?</h1>
<p>Git is an open-source version control system. Or in other words, it is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.</p>
<h1>How I've been using Github</h1>
<p>I have been getting more comfortable and using Github all semester for various classes. In our web development class, I have been using it to clone lab repositories, work on them on my local machine, and then "push" the code to the cloud-based repository where it can be viewed by the professor. For my senior design class, my team has been using Github to build a web app. Each member can create their own dev branches, work on their part of the code, and then merge it into the main repository of our app. This is helping us slowly build our app piece by piece, from the comfort of our own devices that are not connected besides to one main Github repository.</p>
