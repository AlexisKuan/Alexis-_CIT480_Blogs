    <h1><b>What is Ansible?</b></h1>
        <p>Ansible is a simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. Ansible was designed for multi-tier deployments and it models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, instead of just managing one system at a time. Ansible is easy to deploy as it uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure. It also uses a relatively simple language: YAML. YAML is used in the form of Ansible Playbooks that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that is similar to plain English.</p>

    <h1><b>Ansible Architecture</b></h1>
        <p>Ansible works through "Ansible Modules" which are small programs that are connected and pushed through your nodes. An Ansible module is written to be a model of the desired state of a system, meaning that each module defines what should be true on any given managed node. With Ansible, every workstation in an organization can be updated overnight with the latest required software for the company. Ansible's packaging module determines at each node whether the node's state matches the desired state of the Ansible package. If they don't match, Ansible will install or change required items, or update already existing software to match every other node in the work environment. </p>
    <h1><b>Ansible Playbooks</b></h1>
        <p>While modules provide the means of accomplishing a task, the way you use them is through an Ansible playbook. An Ansible playbooks is a configuration file written in YAML that provides instructions for what needs to be done in order to bring a managed node into the desired state. Playbooks are meant to be simple, human-readable, and self-documenting. Playbooks can be run on any system and any time and not have any negative effects. An already properly configured system will remain that way even after having a playbook ran on it.</p>
        <pre><b>Example of a playbook:</b>
            <code>
                ---
                -hosts: web_server
                  tasks:
                - name: Install nginx
                            yum: name=nginx state=present
                - name: Start nginx
                            service: name=nginx state=started
            </code>
        </pre>
