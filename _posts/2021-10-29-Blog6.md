<h1>What is Angular?</h1>
    <p>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications. Angular is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, Angular itself (or AngularJS), and Node.js server runtime environment. The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular application is defined by a set of NgModules.</p>
<h1>Modules</h1>
    <p>An NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional units. Every Angular application has a root module, conventionally named <code>AppModule</code>, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. An application typically contains many functional modules.</p>
<h1>Components</h1>
    <p>Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component hierarchy with the page document object model (DOM). Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment. The <code>@Component()</code> decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component, and provides the template and related component-specific metadata.</p>
<h1>Services</h1>
    <p>For data or logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that you want to share across components, you create a service class. A service class definition is immediately preceded by the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator. The decorator provides the metadata that allows other providers to be injected as dependencies into your class.</p>
